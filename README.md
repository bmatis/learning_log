# Learning Log
Django-based web app for journaling about what you've learned in different
topics.

Allows users to:
* Create an account
* Create different topics (e.g. Programming, Cooking, Knife Throwing)
* Write simple text posts in each topic
* Edit their posts

This project is primarily a Python & Django learning exercise, and is based
upon the lessons provided in Eric Matthes book, Python Crash Course.

I've extended the app in the book to also:
* Allow switching between topics via a dropdown in the main navigation
* Provide a dashboard screen for logged in users, which provides some quick
statistics about how many topics and posts they have, as well as table listing
of all posts.
